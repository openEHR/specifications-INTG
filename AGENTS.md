# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in **specifications-INTG**.

## What this repo is

`specifications-INTG` is the **document source** for the openEHR **INTG** (Integration) component. It is a *specification* repo, not software: the deliverables are the HTML specs at https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/INTG/. Sources are **AsciiDoc** prose; the committed `docs/*.html` files are build artefacts.

`manifest.json` is the source of truth for which documents exist, their `spec_status`, releases, and the `SPECINTG` Jira roadmap. Published documents: none yet (add them to `manifest.json`).

INTG collects integration specifications that sit between openEHR models and external formats: the Template Data Schema (TDS), an XSD derived from a template, and the Template Data Object (TDO), a class skeleton derived from a template. Both are generated from Operational Templates, so they depend on AM, and the resulting documents carry RM content. The component currently has only the landing page `docs/index.adoc`; the TDS/TDO documents themselves are not yet in this repo, and `manifest.json` lists no specifications.

## Layout

- `docs/<document>/master.adoc` plus `masterNN-*.adoc` chapters (`master00` = amendment record); `manifest_vars.adoc` is generated from `manifest.json` on publish.
- `.asciidoctorconfig` — attributes for editor previews (`:component:`, `:imagesdir:`).

## Use the `openehr-specs@openehr` plugin

The plugin carries the spec-authoring know-how — **prefer its skills/agents over ad-hoc edits.** Don't re-derive their workflows here. `.claude/settings.json` registers the `openehr` marketplace and enables the plugin; Claude Code asks you to trust the folder first. To install it by hand: `/plugin marketplace add openEHR/ai-plugins`, then `/plugin install openehr-specs@openehr`.

## Build tool invocation

Docker is all you need to render the documents. All `specifications-XX` repos, including `specifications-AA_GLOBAL` (boilerplate, references), are cloned as siblings under one parent directory. Render from that parent directory:

```bash
# render HTML. The image is published from specifications-AA_GLOBAL; its entrypoint passes -q
# (package-qualified class files). Use `Release-X.Y.Z` instead of `development` for a release build.
docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$PWD:/documents/" ghcr.io/openehr/asciidoctor development INTG
```

The build prints `generated <file>` and exits 0 even when includes are missing, so read the log: any `ERROR` or `include file not found` line means incomplete output. It also rewrites the tracked `docs/*.html` artefacts.

## Conventions

### Commit messages

- **Format:** `Changes for <KEY> - <what changed>`, one line, for example `Changes for SPECINTG-42 - fix typos in the overview chapter`. Say what changed in the specification, not which file.
- **Several tickets:** join the numbers, `Changes for SPECINTG-49/50 - <what changed>`.
- **Every commit that has a Jira ticket carries its key.** Take it from, in order: the user, the branch name (`feat/SPECINTG-42-<slug>`), or the Jira issue the task links to (the `atlassian-openehr` MCP server can look an issue up). Never invent or guess a key.
- **Which key:** `SPECINTG` for this component (change requests), `SPECPR` for problem reports, `SPECPUB` for publishing and tooling issues, or the owning component's key (`SPECAM`, `SPECRM`, ...) when the change belongs there. See skill `openehr-specs:governance`.
- **No ticket:** write a plain summary without a key and say so in the pull request; do not use a placeholder key.
- Some history, mostly in other components, puts the key last, `<what changed> (SPECINTG-42)`. It is understood, but use the leading form here.
- A change to published specification text also needs an amendment-record entry with the same ticket (skill `openehr-specs:amendment-record`).
- Do not stage regenerated `docs/*.html` or generated class tables together with source changes unless the task is to refresh them.

### Branches

- Branch from `master` as `feat/<KEY>-<slug>` or `fix/<KEY>-<slug>`, for example `feat/SPECINTG-42-template-id`, and merge to `master` by pull request.
